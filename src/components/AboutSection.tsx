          My journey into the world of web development began in an unexpected
          place. Originally a finance major, I quickly realized that numbers and
          markets didn&apos;t spark my creativity the way technology did. In a
          bold move, I switched gears and dove into Graphic Information
          Technology with a concentration in Full-Stack Web Development at
          Arizona State University. It was a decision that would redefine my
          future.

          As I immersed myself in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and more, I discovered
          a passion for coding that I had never felt in finance. My academic
          performance skyrocketed, and I took on roles that challenged and
          expanded my capabilities. I became the President of the GIT Coding
          Club, where I led projects and workshops that brought coding to life
          for others. My efforts were recognized with the Dean&apos;s Award
          every semester, culminating in receiving the Outstanding Graduate
          Award.

          Today, I stand proud as a developer who thrives on creating innovative
          web solutions that marry functionality with aesthetics. Whether
          it&apos;s leading a team, crafting a complex backend system, or
          designing a user-friendly interface, I bring my all.
